        <h2>Our History and Ambitions</h2>
        <p class="hero-subtitle"> Building a vibrant German-speaking academic and cultural community at the University of Geneva.</p>
        <p>The German-Speaking Students’ Association of the University of Geneva was founded on 19 October 2025. It was officially registered as an affiliated association of the University on 25 November 2025.</p>
        <p>While our history is still short, our ambitions are high.</p>
        <p>The goal of the association is to promote the learning and use of the German language.</p>
        <p>Through group activities, we aim to create a sense of home for German-speaking students and a welcoming learning environment for all Germanophiles.</p>
